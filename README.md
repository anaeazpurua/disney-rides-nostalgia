# How nostalgic is Disney's Magic Kingdom?

My main goal with this project was to practice basic commands in Python with a small dataset. I wanted to gain confidence and make sure I was understanding the language. 

I chose this dataset because, during a recent visit to Magic Kingdom, I kept thinking about a similar trip I made with my family in 1993. I wondered how many of the rides were the same. 

I found a dataset at TouringPlans.com that contained information on the attractions, including when each had opened. However, it was incomplete. I created a new dataset with the missing attractions in Google Sheets, download it as a csv, and then add it to the original dataset (https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/crowd-calendar#DataSets). I used an official map of Magic Kingdom to corroborate all the current attractions.

I analyzed the data in a jupyter notebook. I knew many of the attractions at Magic Kingdom were there in 1993, but I was surprised by how many of them opened in the 70s. I also thought Fantasyland was the oldest part of the park. It does have many rides that date back to Magic Kingdom's opening, but it has introduced many new attractions; although, most of the new offerings are not rides, but opportunities to meet Disney's characters, like . 

### New skills & growth

This is the first time I use Python for a project. I

Also, although I had worked with ai2html before, I had never done it using my own laptop (not the one from my former employer with all the fonts and special setup).

### Regrets
If I had more time... 
- Better graphics. The fonts I chose in Illustrator disappeared when I ran ai2html. 
- It would be better to have the maps side by side for the desktop version of the story.
- Polish the text. I wrote pretty fast because I spent most of my time on the analysis.
